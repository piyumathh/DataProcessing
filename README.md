# DataProcessing

Database.java has the Database class which utilizes a map to store and process data. 
The DBTests.java file contains three unit tests containing the sample code from the assignment pdf.
Junit is needed to run the tests.
To setup JUnit in IntelliJ, 
  File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies -> "+" icon -> Library -> From Maven -> copy and paste "org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.0.0" (or later version) -> ok

I haven't used other IDEs myself, but this should help for VSCode
